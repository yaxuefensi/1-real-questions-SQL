Table Account ID
Account    date              Status  Spend
123           08-08-2018     Open      4
123           08-09-2018     Open      0
123           08-10-2018     Fraud     2
123           08-11-2018     Fraud     0

Active定义是spend > 0

Q1: What's the percentage of fraud user in active user in each date

Q2: How many user are first time labled as 'Fraud' Today


My Solution:
1) Is it possible that account will have more than 1 status in one day? My understanding should be 'No'.
2) how to define active? is it spend> 0  for any day for one account?

SELECT date, SUM(CASE WHEN tbl.status = 'Fraud' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/COUNT(tbl.acct_id) AS fraud_rate
FROM
(
SELECT date, acct_id, status
FROM account
WHERE spend >0
) AS tbl
GROUP BY date;


2)






数据不是很确定，所以我加了一行，假设同一个用户一天内多笔交易，有fraud 和non fraud， 即 primary key 为account, date, status，这个逻辑
一天内有多笔fraud 不行
Table Account ID
Account    date              Status  Spend
123           08-08-2018     Open     4
123           08-09-2018     Open     0-
123           08-10-2018     Fraud    2
123           08-10-2018     Normal   1
123           08-11-2018     Fraud    0

Active定义是spend > 0

Q1: What's the percentage of fraud user in active user in each date

Select date, sum(case when "status" =='Fraud' then 1 else 0 end)/count(distinct account)
from table
where account in
(select account
From table
Group by date, account
Having sum(spend)>0
) -- Find active user 
group by date

Q2: How many user are first time labled as 'Fraud' Today

Select count(account) from
(
Select Row_number() over (partition by account order by date asc) as rank, * 
from table 
Where status = 'Fraud'
)
Where rank = 1 and  date = current_date()
