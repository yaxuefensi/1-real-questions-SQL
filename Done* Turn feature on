1. There is table that tracks every time a user turns a feature on or off, with columns user_id, action ("on" or "off), 
   date, and time. 

1) How many users turned the feature on today? 
USER_ID || ACTION||DATE||TIME 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT tbl.user_id) as user_on_cnt
FROM
(
SELECT DISTINCT date, user_id, action
FROM action
WHERE date=curdate() AND action = 'on'
) AS tbl


2) Create a table that tracks the user last status every day. 

CREATE TABLE last_status (
date date,
time time,
user_id int,
status char
);


3) In a table that tracks the status of every user every day, how would you add today's data to it?   

INSERT INTO last_status
VALUES (date, time, user_id, status);


5), 如何找出在一天之内始终保持feature on的人，(given status table and action table). 

SELECT DISTINCT date, user_id, action
FROM action
