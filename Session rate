analytics (Case)

  
Market Place want to add a new feature, add a sell button on the top when enter market place. 1point3acres
  

   
Why we want to build this feature?
   
What Metric we need to measure this?
   
How to test?
  
  
Use the number of message sent to sellers/sessions to measure, the number decreased 10%. From 1point 3acres bbs
  

   
Why?
   
How would you measure it and test it?
   
What could we do?

谢谢楼主， 能具体说下Case第二题的意思嘛，number of message sent to sellers/sessions 和第一题有关吗

就是第一问里定义了一个session指的是每一个user每次进入marketplace算作一个session，然后在每个session里的number of message sent to seller
